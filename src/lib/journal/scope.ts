 *   must be the owner and the target must have signed in (so their settings rows
 *   exist). Returns the service-role admin client scoped to that member's id.
 *
 * Because the admin client bypasses RLS, callers MUST add `.eq("user_id",

 * member mode. The returned `userId` always comes from a trusted email→user_id
